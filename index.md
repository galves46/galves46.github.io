I fell in love with coding as an hobby, now I aim for coding to be my life.

Self-educated and curious, I love to break down new challenges.

I'm currently busy with [DokusCore](https://dokuscore.com/), a RedM Framework build for quality with love.
This is an open source project, you're welcome to contribute.

I'm also a student at [42Network](https://www.42network.org/).






```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main{
  printf("Skills in development:\n");
  printf("lua, html, css, js, c, unix, api usage, database, arduino and system administration");
}
```
